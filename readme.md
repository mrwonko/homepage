# My Website

Frontend of my website, powered by Pelican.

Includes blog posts in content/blog/ and static pages in content/pages/

Note that "absolute" pelican filenames (i.e. {filename}/whatever) don't work on 3.5.0 on Windows, at least not for me - latest version required, try `pip install -e git+https://github.com/getpelican/pelican#egg=pelican`
