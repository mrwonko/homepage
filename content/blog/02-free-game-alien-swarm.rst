:summary: Alien Swarm just got released. For free. Hooray? Yep.

`Alien Swarm <http://store.steampowered.com/app/630/>`__ just got
released. For free. Hooray?

Well, I don't know. Appearently I'm not the only one who noticed, the
download is pretty slow. Once it's done I'll try it out and tell you
what I think.

So far I think it's probably great. I like nice top-down shooters like
Shadowgrounds or Alien Shooter. This one is based on an old Unreal
Tournament 2004 mod whose developers were hired by Valve and helped
create the Left 4 Dead series. Now they're working on Portal 2. And
appearently they've also had time to port their mod over to the Source
Engine.

So far every Valve game I've played was great. Half-Life 2? One of my
favorite shooters, maybe the favorite. Left 4 Dead? Great Coop fun.
Portal? Cake. I'm pretty positive Alien Swarm's great as well. I'll know
soon enough.

I don't know if you knew but I want to be a programmer. A professional
programmer programming for a living, that is. I'm already a programmer,
I just wouldn't call myself professional yet. Well, the game's
sourcecode is available for free so I'll have the chance to look at it
and maybe learn from it. In fact I'm already downloading it.

Well, more on that later when I've had the chance to play it and look at
the source.

--------------

Okay, now I've played it. And it's a lot of fun! I suggest everybody
grab it, especially since it's free. There's a nice tilebased level
editor included, unfortunately only one tileset is available. The
community will create more though, thus fixing the game's biggest flaw:
its lack of levels. There's only one so-called "campaign" (consisting of
multiple levels) included and completing takes like two hours or so.
Unlockable new weapons keep you playing though.
