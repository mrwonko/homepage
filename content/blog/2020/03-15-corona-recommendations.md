summary: Hello Corona

Social isolation is as good a reason to start blogging again as any, I suppose.

We're in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic. Germany is about to close its borders. Restaurants, bars, cinemas etc. are being shut down.

In the interest of my sanity I took a walk earlier today. There are still a lot of people about on this Sunday. The playground was busy. So much for social isolation. I'm concerned.

As a software engineer I can thankfully work from home. My privilege extends into times of trouble.
