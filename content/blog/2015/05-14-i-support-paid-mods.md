summary: My thoughts on the recent paid mods on Steam shenanigans: I support paid mods.

Valve recently [introduced paid mods](http://steamcommunity.com//games/SteamWorkshop/announcements/detail/208632365237576574), which started a bit of a shit storm and [they were quickly rolled back](http://steamcommunity.com/games/SteamWorkshop/announcements/detail/208632365253244218). Since I was in the middle of my [relaunch]({filename}05-08-website-relaunch.md) I haven't posted my opinion on this yet.

But others have already said what I think, so let me just quote. Garry Newman wrote [a blog post outlining his thoughts](http://garry.tv/2015/04/24/paying-for-mods/), which I agree with. George Broussard summed the negative reaction up nicely:

<blockquote>
	<p>Critics of paid mods seem to hide behind “the % was unfair” but the reality is “we want our free stuff free forever”. Sorry mod makers.</p>

</blockquote>

While Garry used somewhat stronger words:

<blockquote>
	<p>Valve broke the modding community... by revealing that most of them are cunts.</p>
	&mdash; Garry Newman (@garrynewman) <a href="https://twitter.com/garrynewman/status/591667165335560193">April 24, 2015</a>
</blockquote>

So my opinion in short:

*	I'd appreciate if modders had the option to sell their mods.
*	Of course they'd have to respect IP, a Star Wars mod for Skyrim should probably not be monetized.
*	There are multiple technical problems with Skyrim's Steam Workshop integration; if you force people who want to sell their mods to use that instead of the Nexus, it needs to work at least as well first.
*	Publishers making money from mods might lead to modding support in more games.
*	Modders making money from mods might lead to more and better mods. Maybe not better on average, but more good mods.
*	Having to pay for mods isn't all that different from paying for games. Support people doing things you like.
*	Abuse is a problem but I believe the community can take care of moderation if you manage to distinguish between trustworthy and malicious users, e.g. by seeding the system with hand-selected "good" people and then comparing report patterns. This problem will need to be addressed anyway by the time the store is opened to everybody.

And the super short version: I support paid mods.
