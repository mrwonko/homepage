:summary: I'm programming again. Finally.

I recently started programming again. Feels good. :-)

I've continued work on my input system, which so far only supported
keyboards. Now I've got gamepad support, mostly. One important thing I
wanted to have was XInput support, for proper support of the XBox 360
gamepad (both analog triggers, rumble function), but I also want
DirectInput for legacy reasons.

Now I've got all that, except for rumbling on DirectInput devices. I
don't have any DirectInput gamepads that are capable of rumbling. Well,
I *didn't*. Just grabbed one off eBay, for a mere 6â‚¬. I doubt it's good
but it'll suffice. I feel a little crazy for buying a gamepad just to be
able to program, but that's okay. Nothing wrong with being a little
crazy.

The only other thing still missing is mouse support, then input is done,
I believe. Nice. Getting stuff done feels good. I still need to get more
stuff done before I have something usable, but I'm getting there. I'll
then start by doing Pong, and probably some simple 2D games, before
starting work on that big space shooting sidescroller I plan to do some
day.

But back to the present: I'm about to go and enjoy a concert by Van
Canto & In Legend, looking forward to it. I may not be able to return
though since the last train leaves at around 12:30am, I don't know if
the concert will be over by then. I don't want to say I hope so, either,
since that'd mean it'd be shorter... Nothing I can do about that anyway.
I'm not going alone, some friends will go there too, so I won't be alone
in Hamburg.

So long,

Willi
