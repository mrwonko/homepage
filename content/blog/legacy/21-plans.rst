Just recently I saw `a talk about not telling your
goals <http://www.ted.com/talks/derek_sivers_keep_your_goals_to_yourself.html>`__.
It basically claims that you already get all the positive feedback you'd
ever want when you tell someone your plans, making actual execution
unnecessary. Luckily I don't ever get any feedback (besides spam) on
this blog so I might as well post my plans.

This weekend I'm going to participate in the Mini `Ludum
Dare <http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/>`__ 23, a 48h game making
competition. I'm curious if I'll be able to build a game from ground up
using SFML in 48 hours.

And yesterday `TIGSource <http://www.tigsource.com/>`__ was recommended
to me, it's supposedly a nice community of game developers. Just minutes
after that they announced a competition, the `Versus
Competition <http://www.tigsource.com/2011/01/18/tigcompo-versus/>`__.
Its goal is the creation of a competitive multiplayer game. I know that
I'd better look into multiplayer some day and this seems like a good
opportunity. It will end on the 27th of February.

The next day my final written exams in school, the "Schriftliches
Abitur", will take place. I'm pretty confident that I'll do good, even
without spending much of my spare time learning. May do it anyway, but
I'll likely still have enough time for the Versus TIGCompo.

So long,

Willi
