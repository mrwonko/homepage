:summary: I talk about my final exams in school, games and coding.

What have I been doing recently?

The most noteworthy thing is probably my written Abitur, the final
school exam. I think I did best in maths, but the other subjects,
English and physics, were okay, too. In less than 3 months I will be
done with school altogether.

I recently bought Bulletstorm and actually finished the singleplayer,
twice even. I liked it. Two friends bought it, too, but we have not yet
really played online together. One of them is unable to active his key.

I also finished Chaser, which I got during the last Steam holiday sale.
It was okay and pretty long. I also recently bought and finished Call of
Juarez: Bound in Blood. I had been wanting to play it for quite some
time, but it was still better than I expected. I had a lot of fun.

On the other hand, I haven't done any coding for almost a whole month. I
believe that is because I don't know the "best" solution. If such a
thing even exists. I think I should stop trying to achieve perfection
and just code, gathering experience that I can later use to improve. Or
maybe I'm just lazy.

So long,

Willi
