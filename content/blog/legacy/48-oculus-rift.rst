:summary: So I got an Oculus Rift! Exciting, right? Right?

I'm easily sold on innovative technology, apparently. 2 years ago I
bought the Razer Hydra because it seemed like a cool idea. Precise
absolute 6DOF tracking? Yay! Think of all the cool things I could
program for that! Intuitive modelling, lightsaber wielding and much
more! In the end I never actually used it much...

So in early April, when the first Oculus Rift developer kits had been
shipped, I got pretty hyped. Another technology with potential! Virtual
reality! I totally need to support that! And that's the story of how I
bought a devkit.

It arrived in early August and needless to say I haven't used it much so
far. Or made anything for it. I don't really regret getting it, but that
may just be the post-purchase-rationalization speaking. Well, here's
hoping it'll be of some use to me in the coming year, before the
consumer version is out, because otherwise I should've just waited for
that.
