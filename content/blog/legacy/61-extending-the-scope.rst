I just realized I should more often do things beyond just keeping a
journal on this blog. My life isn't really interesting enough for that
to be valuable to anybody, at least at the moment. Sure, when
interesting things happen to me that may be worth writing about... But
there's so much more I can write.

In particular, I should more often comment on things that matter to me.
Be it news, events, ideas, some game I've played, whatever. Sharing some
of my thoughts on different matters is probably more interesting than
what minor thing I've done this fortnight.

Of course I already do that to a degree. Briefly mentioning what I
thought of some game I've played and so on. I just think I should expand
on that.

I'll try to do that in the future.

So long,

Willi
