:summary: I'm Anti-GamerGate. Also, can we all please be nice to each other?

There's recently been some controversy about the objectivity of video
game reviews. My take on that? If you want objective game reviews, read
`Objective Game Reviews <http://www.objectivegamereviews.com/>`__. But I
don't want objective game reviews, I'm fine with reviewers having
previous experiences and biases. Yes, tell me what *you* think about the
game. And please don't give me a score out of hundred, there's no way
you can rate anything that precisely. If you absolutely need a score,
make it out of five, but better yet, omit it altogether. That's why
gaming website of choice is `Rock, Paper,
Shotgun <http://www.rockpapershotgun.com>`__, where the reviews are
called "Wot I Think" and have no scores. That, and the fact that I like
the authors and their style of writing.

So much for reasonable discussion and criticism. Sadly, that's not
really what the last weeks have been about. Instead, some people are
once again throwing around death threats on the internet, stealing
accounts, publicizing private information and being generally hateful. I
really don't get how anybody can be so vicious. I suppose it's a matter
of education, some people have very weird values.

And it's fairly widespread. You only have to read some comments on the
internet for an unhealthy dose of hate and stupidity. Personally, I just
get depressed really quickly and try to avoid reading comments these
days. There's only so much negativity I'm willing to expose myself to
when there are so many nicer things I could do instead and there's so
little to be gained from it.

This may be a good time to educate one of my readers. Here's a comment
for my last post which I chose not to approve:

    I thought you were going to write a blog post twice a month. I knew
    that was just talk.

That's not particularly hateful, there's much worse, but what does that
comment achieve? The first half correctly observes that I haven't been
writing as much as I had once set out to, but the second sentence really
just turns it into an attack on me, doesn't it? It's not a comment that
invites any kind of useful discussion or provides helpful insight. I
reserve the right to moderate my comments and delete any I deem
unhealthy to the discussion. You are welcome to disagree with me, of
course, just don't be a dick.

Maybe this person meant to say "I thought you were going to write a blog
post twice a month. I was looking forward to your next post, please take
the time to write one soon, there are actually people who appreciate
it." That could have encouraged me to write one earlier. But as it
stands, the comment just has the potential to make me feel bad. Which
may be the intent, there are tons of trolls who thrive on angering
others, but I'm inclined to follow Hanlon's Razor here.

I just wish people were nicer to each other, even (or especially!) when
they disagree.

Peace,

Willi
