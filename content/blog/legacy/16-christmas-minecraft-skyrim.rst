:summary: I'm talking about christmas, minecraft and other games.

|image0|\ It's Christmas once again! Yay! More relatives are going to
visit tomorrow, but here are the presents I've received so far:

-  Minority Report (book)
-  Venetica (game)
-  Bob Marley - Uprising
-  400g of Marzipan - Yummy!
-  Deathspank (Steam sale at just the right time :) )
-  Shoes

So no big presents, but I like all of them; I currently don't need
anything big anyway, I'm very happy satisfied as it is.

Thinking ahead I had already bought a Half-Life 2 10-pack and a Left 4
Dead 2 6-pack at the Steam Thanksgiving Sale so I had some presents for
those of my friends unfortunate enough to not own those games yet. Since
I don't have 10 friends without Half-Life 2 my *free Half-Life 2 for the
first non-spam comment* offer still stands. That also means I needed
some other presents for the other friends. Luckily CS:S and the Overlord
Series are currently on sale on Steam - which two friends of mine want.
Or wanted. Now they've got them. :-D

I also just bought the Indie 2D Pack on Steam since it contains VVVVVV
(which seems interesting) and is currently only 4,50€. Today I checked
out all the games besides VVVVVV - I especially like Galcon Fusion, the
pack also contains Super Laser Racer, Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved and
Bullet Candy. Bullet Candy surprised me since it's so simple, I think if
I keep on programming for a bit I may be able to write something
similar, complexity-wise. Which means I may be able to make a Euro or
two on Steam, soon. (Within the next year?) That'd certainly be cool.

I've also bought the Oddbox, since I played Abe's Odyssey a loooong time
ago when it was on a videogame magazine's CD (which I've long lost) and
never finished it and kinda liked it and it was only 12,50€.

And I don't think I've mentioned that I bought Minecraft (just before it
turned beta and became more expensive). It's very fun, especially since
after seeing me play it a couple of friends immediately wanted it, too.
Now we play it together in multiplayer and have a very good time.

I haven't expressed my anticipation for The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim and
Mass Effect 3 yet, either. Since BioWare had announced that they'll
reveal something at the Spike Video Game Awards I stayed up until 4am
watching bad quality live streams. The game turned out to be Mass Effect
3, and I'm really looking forward to it. I totally did not expect the
next Elder Scrolls game to be revealed as well, though. Caught me by
surprise, in a very positive way. I loved Oblivion and spent multiple
hundred hours in it, I just hope the new engine in The Elder Scrolls 5:
Skyrim will be (at least) as moddable as Gamebryo.

This post became longer than I expected... Guess I should write more
often if I want the posts to be shorter.

Merry Christmas.
