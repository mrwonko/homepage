:summary: Some corrections on my initial Gamescom impression of Dishonored...

Just a quick followup on my thoughts on the Dishonored Gamescom demo,
which left me a little underwhelmed: After playing the full game for 2h
I'm much more excited. It's a beautiful world, which a 15 minute demo
can hardly convey.

Update: 40 hours of Dishonored later I can safely say my initial
impression was correct. A wonderful game. No, I did not spend all that
time on a single playthrough, the first one took me about 20h, but
shouldn't a game's length take multiple playthroughs into account?
