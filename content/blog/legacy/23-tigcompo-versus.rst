Recently I wrote about my plans. They included participating in Mini
Ludum Dare 23 - `which I successfully
did <{filename}/pages/download.html#id=25>`__ - and in the Versus
competition at `TIGSource.com <http://www.tigsource.com/>`__. Which I'm
also doing - see `my forum thread
there <http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=17218>`__ for updates
on that.

And while there's a lot of work to do and I'm not sure I'll make it in
time, I am still pretty productive since I'm forced to work. Deadlines
help. And since I've decided to work cleanly, creating components to be
reused in Jedi Academy: Renaissance (as opposed to doing it
quick'n'dirty), it may be more work but it will be worth it.

So long,

Willi
