:summary: Moving folders or: How I freed 16 GB on C:

I just freed 16 GB on C:, mostly by disabling hibernation (which doesn't
work with >4gb ram anyway), moving the windows search index (>6 GB!) and
My Documents (another 4 GB).

Determining that those directories were the biggest space users was
pretty easy thanks to the tool `WinDirStat <http://windirstat.info/>`__
which is very useful when trying to figure out where all that free space
went.

Coding-wise I haven't done enough recently... I don't quite know where to
start with the menu/hud system coding, or at least I keep telling myself
so.
