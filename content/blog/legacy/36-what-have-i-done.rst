:summary: I reflect on my life so far in a slightly résumé/portfolio-esque way.

Yesterday I read `a great article by Valve employee Michael
Abrash <http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/abrash/valve-how-i-got-here-what-its-like-and-what-im-doing-2/>`__
(and I suggest you do the same). I noticed it thanks to a tweet by Jeri
Ellsworth who recently started working at Valve, too, so I thanked her:

    `@jeriellsworth <https://twitter.com/#%21/jeriellsworth>`__ Great
    post, thanks! Reinforced my wish to join you after university.
    Looking forward to the "what we look for" post, too.

The "what we look for" post I'm referring to is an upcoming post Micheal
Abrash talked about in his article, but you should already know that,
having read it as I suggested. Right? Anyway, she promptly replied:

    `@mrwonko <https://twitter.com/#%21/mrwonko>`__ We don't require
    degrees here. <wink>

Which made me think about whether I could join Valve today. What
exprience do I have? What projects have I done?

First of all: I'm going to continue studying. The second semester has
just started and I'm learning a lot. On Thursday I started programming
in Assembler and I'm also learning about Finite State Machines and all
kinds of other interesting things. I'm pretty sure I'll profit from
this.

That didn't keep me from thinking about my portfolio and my résumé
though. Let's go back and look at what I've done in a roughly
chronological order.

Aside from some strategy game map making I'm pretty sure I started
modding in 2003 (or maybe late 2002) with Jedi Knight 2, creating custom
maps. I switched to Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy when it came out in 2003
and eventually got into coding in C through its SDK.

Well, let's note that when I say coding I mean changing some constants
here and there, and when I say eventually that means march 2005, if the
time stamps on the source files are to be trusted. Still, I started
coding and by February 2006 I had done some of NeHe's tutorials on
OpenGL and coded my first game, Suckman. It was supposed to be like
pacman, but I knew it'd suck, hence the name. I actually still have
`binaries <{static}Suckman.7z>`__. Hell, after some
more digging I found out I even still have the source code!

I also started coding in PHP sometime back then, I can't pinpoint the
exact time, but I have some files dating back to may 2005. I *can*
pinpoint the time of my first modelling attempts though: Apparently I
looked into creating Jedi Academy playermodels with a 3D Studio Max
trial in March 2006.

And then Oblivion came out, only days later. I got it on release and
played for hundreds of hours, literally. And I also looked into
modelling. That was around May 2006 and I was using the free modelling
software Blender by then, which I still use today. I don't think I ever
released any of my Oblivion mods, they were mostly me messing around. As
so often I had ambitious projects that I didn't finish.

In September 2006 I joined 3D-GET, the 3D Game Engineering Team, a group
of Jedi Academy modders that were working on a new singleplayer
campaign. Initial momentum had died down after over 3 years and they
were hoping to finish the mod soon, but it's still unreleased to this
date, although we (i.e. the 3 remaining team members) would love to see
it finished. Most levels were visually done but lacked
gameplay/scripting - which was partially my responsibility and is mostly
done by now - as well as cohesion; They were built by separate people
with only a loose story to tie them together. There was also barely any
playtesting so far, which is bad. Here's hoping we get it released, too
much work went into it for it to just die. Still, so far it's just
another ambitious project I haven't finished.

Around that time I started really getting into coding as well, thanks to
a C++ coding club in school. I had read a little about OOP before but it
wasn't until then that I truly understood classes. So I worked on quite
some projects in the following years, notably a Latin vocabulary trainer
in September 2007 and a console-based Tetris in May 2008. (Fun fact: In
order to not have to do last semester's coding exercise I had to write a
console-based Tetris in Pascal.)

I also started doing Case Modding in Summer 2007. That included dabbling
in electronics and programming some microcontrollers. The peak and
turning point was my participation in the Games Convention Casemod
Masters at the 2007 Games Convention (the last one), after that it died
down.

I can't think of any remarkable projects in the following years... I
briefly evaluated several engines like Ogre3D, irrlicht and Newton Game
Dynamics and somehow got into Python and Lua, the latter possibly
through modding Supreme Commander.

Pretty much all my remarkable projects (and some unremarkable and/or
unfinished ones) since 2010 should be be available either on this
website or on `my github page <https://github.com/mrwonko/>`__. I
started doing Ludum Dare games and some other small projects, but my
most ambitious project so far is what will eventually be a Jedi Academy
recode, Jedi Academy: Renaissance. Until then, it's going to be a series
of games reusing the same components and built with future use for Jedi
Academy in mind.

So I have quite some experience but lack big projects to back that claim
up. Is it enough to get hired by Valve? I doubt it, but honestly I don't
know. Michael Abrash promised to write an article on what they're
looking for in people, that should give me a better idea of how good a
fit I am, as well as some pointers to how I should improve.

I'd really like to work at Valve.

So long,

Willi

**Appendix I**

I actually forgot the Ace I've got up my sleeve. `My video for the
Midnight Riders music video
contest <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYRtfJ5iShI>`__. It got an
honorable mention for best use of black and white so a lot of Valve
employees have already seen one of my works, which is probably a good
thing.
