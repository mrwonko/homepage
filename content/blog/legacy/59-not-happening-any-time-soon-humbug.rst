:summary: I bought a PS3 after all, and I'm coding.

Remember how I said I wasn't going to buy a PS3 any time soon due to my
backlog on PC? Disregard that, I got one after all. Now happily playing
through Demon's Souls, Red Dead Redemption and Okami HD.

Besides that and the usual Uni work there's a programming competition
for students going on: Writing a 2048 AI. Marcus and I have entered and
we're now trying to win by breaking the game's RNG, which is
intentionally weak. And that's pretty much all that's happening.

So long,

Willi
