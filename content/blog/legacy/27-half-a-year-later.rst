:summary: A lot has happened in the last 3 months.

Wait, it's been 3 months since I last wrote something? Wow.

By now enough has happened for another post to be justified... by far.
So prepare for information!

The first couple of weeks I spent in school. Then, in June, I was
suddenly done.

Before that happened, I started watching My Little Pony: Friendship is
Magic, which is surprisingly awesome. I'm not quite sure if that was
before or after my last blog post, but it doesn't matter, I don't think
I mentioned it here yet but I ought to.

Starting in October, I willÂ  study computer science. Until then, I'm
doing an internship coding software.

I'm also on on `Google
Plus <https://plus.google.com/101127119059250564535/posts>`__ now.

Next week I'll attend the Gamescom. I'll be there on Thursday and Friday
and fellow My Little Pony fans (and everybody else) may feel free to
meet me at 12 an 4pm between halls 6 and 7. I'll wear a `jedi robe and a
button <http://www.mrwonko.de/images/cam/robe+mark_sm.png>`__ so I'll be
quite recognizable.

Since I'd like to shoot some videos I got myself a (used) Kodak Zi8.
Very acceptable quality considering its price. Except the price
increases if you also buy a second battery, an SD card and an external
microphone, like I did.

Also, my old Jedi Academy modding team 3D-Get is currently being
revived. We're going to finish our old Single Player mod.

That's all I can think of at the moment, but that *is* quite a lot
already, isn't it?

So long,

Willi
