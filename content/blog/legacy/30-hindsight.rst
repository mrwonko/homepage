:summary: I think back to what I achieved last year and make some plans for the next one. You don't have to wait for New Year's Day to do that, right?

I just happened to think back to what I achieved in the last year/couple
of months. And it's not much. Besides finishing school. But coding-wise
I hardly got anything done. Some Ludum Dare games, but that's it, pretty
much. And the Razer Hydra DirectInput Wrapper. Really not that much...

But maybe I'm looking at it the wrong way. In this last year I've been
the most productive ever, I think. Before last year, I hardly got
anything done. I did improve. I just have to continue to do so.

How can I do so? I've got to get my priorities right.\ |image0|

-  I'll start studying in a month and that should of course be my number
   one priority.
-  Until then, there's a Jedi Academy mapping contest and I just decided
   I'll give that a try. I've got about one month, plenty of time.
-  Once I'm done with that map (or the contest is over, whichever comes
   first) I should concentrate on Spirits of the Sith, the Jedi Academy
   mod my team 3D-Get and I were working on. We recently got back
   together and decided to finish it.
-  After that, I have time to do coding. It'd be nice to get a game on
   Steam and make some money. A good way to prototype some game ideas is
   reportedly to create a game a week, so I might give that a try. By
   then, I might also finally have a Razer Hydra. I'll surely do some
   coding for it - possibly a Jedi Academy mod with 1:1 lightsaber
   control? Or a Half-Life 2 mod with 1:1 gun control? (The latter is
   probably easier.)
-  I should also not forget about my engine - But I'll likely just
   create the weekly games using it.
-  And I should finish some little projects - md3 and Ghoul 2
   im-/exporters for Blender 2.5, for example.

So let's see how much of this I'll get done in the next couple of
months.

So long,

Willi
