:summary: Snow and data loss - are they connected?

|image0|\ It's been snowing and freezing for some days now - I think
that's pretty early.

On another note, one of my HDDs just vanished. Or at least its
partitions partitions did. Among them were my Ubuntu Boot Partition
(containing GRUB things) and a general data partition (containing
amongst others my music, documents and programming stuff). I'll later
write a full image of it before trying any recovery.

I just changed my pc case and added a new 2TB HDD, I don't think that's
connected to my problems though.

Note that this has no influence on my current
write-the-first-comment-competition.

So long,

Willi
