:summary: There's a version 1.6 of the GTK Radiant

Hey,

Jedi Academy mappers probably know this: There are two popular versions
of the GTK Radiant map editor, 1.4 and 1.5. Some mappers - mostly the
old ones like me, who got used to it - prefer 1.4, other prefer 1.5. The
latter is different, but not necessarily better. Or worse.

Either way, those sticking to 1.4 sometimes experience trouble on
Windows 7/Vista - most prominently the save bug which prevents saving
unless you use the GTK file dialog instead of the Windows one, but then
you have to remember to add .map to the filenames.

What most Jedi Academy mappers probably don't know: There's a GTK
Radiant 1.6, a.k.a. ZeroRadiant (hosted on idsoftware's
`zerowing <http://zerowing.idsoftware.com/>`__), based on 1.4. I believe
it started out as an open source version of 1.4 which has since been
improved, but I don't really know everything that's been changed. What I
do know: The save bug is fixed.

So yesterday I spent the evening trying to compile it and set it up for
Jedi Academy - successfully! I think I'll be using it henceforth.

So long,

Willi


**Addendum**

It has since moved from the zerowing to `icculus <http://icculus.org/gtkradiant/>`__ and has official builds. So I no longer supply my ancient build.
