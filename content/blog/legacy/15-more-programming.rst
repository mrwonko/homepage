Hi,

I don't program much at the moment. I'd like to change that.

I believe that one of the problems is my lack of experience. I just need
to program more.

Through Minecraft, or more precisely its developer Markus Persson, I
became aware of Game Jams, competitions/events in which developers try
to create a game in very limited time. Appearently `Markus has built
games <http://www.mojang.com/notch/>`__ for `Ludum
Dare <http://www.ludumdare.com>`__ in 48h, and World of Goo started as
`one prototype amongst many, all developed in one
week <http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/2438/how_to_prototype_a_game_in_under_7_.php>`__.

I like the idea and I think I'll try to create a game for the
`Experimental Gameplay Project <http://experimentalgameplay.com/>`__ in
7 days. The theme is *drawing*. I don't know what I'm going to do yet,
but I'll think about it.

I'll have holidays soon, on Thursday, so I should have plenty of time.
Oh, and there'll be Christmas, but you probably know that. And I still
love the `Steam <http://store.steampowered.com>`__ Holiday Sale.

Willi
