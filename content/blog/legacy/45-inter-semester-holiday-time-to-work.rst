So my last lecture was last Thursday. That means I get over 2 months of
holiday, ending early April. A lot of time, I told myself beforehand.
Surely I can finish a lot of work!

Here's what I've done so far:

-  Played quite some Dota 2
-  Finished my first run of The Cave
-  Finished DmC - Devil May Cry, which was surprisingly good, I'll
   likely give it another go at Son of Sparda Difficulty

And here's what I had planned to do:

-  None of the above (with the possible exception of DmC)
-  Write a Blender Plugin for a friend
-  Improve my Blender Ghoul 2 Plugin
-  Write documentation for my Blender Plugins
-  Update my Python Bindings of the Sixense SDK to Python 3.3
-  Write a game for Uni (I missed the deadline for the previous one, but
   since I had hardly that wasn't so bad and I like the new task better
   anyway)
-  Learn for the exams (the first ones will be next Thursday and Friday,
   I should get going)
-  Finish Reverse Engineering Flatout 2's level format so custom maps
   are possible - a friend of mine will join me after the exams
-  Help `iojamp <https://github.com/dmead/jkaq3>`__
-  Finish `Spirits of the Sith <http://sots-dev.3d-get.de/>`__
-  Write that Turn-Based FPS I originally wanted to do for
   `7DFPS <http://7dfps.org/>`__ - but do it as a Source Mod (that is,
   using the Source Engine)

In conclusion: I'm still a lazy bum. Woe is me! On the bright side, I
now have an idea why I don't do this stuff I actually kinda like. It's
probably because there's no (immediate) reward and/or because I'm too
impulsive, surfing or playing Dota instead. (Compare `How To Beat
Procrastination <http://lesswrong.com/lw/3w3/how_to_beat_procrastination/>`__.)

On the bright side the holiday is far from over, so I might still get
some of this done. I'll have all the time in the world since my
application for a job at Daedalic got rejected - they don't want working
students. Oh, and I haven't coded anything for `One Game A
Month <http://www.onegameamonth.com/>`__ so far, so it looks like I'll
fail that as well.
