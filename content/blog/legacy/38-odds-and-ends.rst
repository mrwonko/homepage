:slug: odds-and-ends

A couple of things from recent months that don't warrant a whole post
each:

-  A couple of friends and I backed `Planetary
   Annihilation <http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/659943965/planetary-annihilation-a-next-generation-rts>`__,
   a spiritual successor to Total Annihilation, which I admittedly did
   not play, and, to a lesser extent, Supreme Commander, which I played
   lots of with friends. It looks amazing and I'm looking forward to
   playing the Beta and the final product.
-  I turned 20. Yay?
-  Exam time. I passed all, but somewhat worse than I would've liked in
   two cases. Due to me lazily learning to little.
-  After spending â‚¬100 in the Steam Summer Sale I decided not to spend
   so much money on games I'm likely never going to play. I only slipped
   up when I bought Total Annihilation and Anachronox on
   `gog.com <http://gog.com>`__ and the Humble Bundle 6. I don't think
   Borderlands 2 and Darksiders 2 count, buying games at full price is
   fine: You can't buy as many, you're more likely to play them and it
   actually makes a difference to the publisher and possibly (hopefully)
   the developer. And I'm playing Borderlands with friends, so that's a
   good reason, too. It's the difference between buying a game because
   you really want to play it versus buying it because it's cheap. Oh,
   and there's also `this great article on Rock, Paper,
   Shotgun <http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2012/07/22/cardboard-children-some-games/>`__.
-  I got a new computer, mostly. Kept my BluRay drive, my HDDs, the PSU
   and the case, but got a new 128GB SSD, an i5-3570K, an HD6950, 16GB
   Ram and a Motherboard to go with it. It's wonderful. The prospect of
   Planetary Annihilation made me be a bit more generous with regards to
   the CPU, which probably wasn't a bad thing.
