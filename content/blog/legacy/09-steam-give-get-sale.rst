:summary: Steam Sale time! Yay!

Steam has another big sale, *The Give & Get Sale*, which focusses on
packs of games. I already mentioned this in the last post but I think
this is worth its own post.

`Steam Store <http://store.steampowered.com>`__

As mentioned before I got myself Sam & Max Season 3, and by now I also
decided to give Prototype a try. I don't have enough space to install
them yet, but my new HDD should arrive in a few days.

I like how Valve is giving away Half-Life 2 for 2€ (if you buy 10). To
celebrate this, and to see whether anybody is actually reading this
blog, the first person to comment on this post  *may* get one copy for
free. Or maybe not, that depends. But chances are (s)he will. Plus,
it'll be the first comment ever, besides the 222 Spam comments blocked
so far.

I feel I should also tell you about the 50% off everything sale at
Telltale Games that I just stumbled upon, though that ends today. I
bought Sam & Max Season 2, now I've got all 3 seasons. Got it even
cheaper because I already had one episode - due to a free giveaway by
them. Season 2 for 10.50$ is even better than Steam's Season 3 for 9.90€
deal. :-)
