Here are some of the things I've made.

# This Website

Built using [Pelican](http://blog.getpelican.com/) from [this Github repo](https://github.com/mrwonko/homepage/) with a custom plugin to allow different types of articles (blog, downloads, tutorials) and a custom theme.

# Perseus Compiler & VM

For my Bachelor thesis I wrote a [compiler and virtual machine for a subset of a programming language of my design](https://github.com/mrwonko/perseus). It currently does little more than integer arithmetic, but with continued work I hope to one day have a useful embedded language for scripts in video games with unique serialization capabilities.

# Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy Plugin Suite for Blender

I'm not a very good artist, but I still do some modelling, and Blender is my tool of choice. It's a wonderful program which can be further adapted to your needs using Python plugins. And that's just what I did - I added support for just about every model-/animation-related file format from Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy so I can mod that game to my heart's content.

# Razer Hydra DirectInput Virtual Gamepad

The Razer Hydra is a motion controller for the PC. The bundled software allows you to map motions to your mouse and keyboard so games without direct support can still be played with it, but mapping 6 axes (plus trigger and analog sticks, and all of that twice; once for each hand) to only 2 analog axes (mouse movement) and buttons is such a waste.

So I wrote a tool that allows you to map the axes and buttons to a virtual gamepad. It allows you to freely configure which kind of movement should be mapped to which axis (or button, if desired).

I have to admit I tend not to finish big games, so having constraints helps. Like Ludum Dare, where you have to create a game within 48 hours. This is one such game, a platformer I wrote in C++ using the framework SFML and the physics library Box2D for Ludum Dare 22.
