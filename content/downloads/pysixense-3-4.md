Windows binaries for my Python binding of the Sixense SDK for the Razer Hydra for Python 3.4. Includes 32 and 64 bit binaries. See the [documentation](https://github.com/mrwonko/PySixense/blob/py34/doc.markdown), too. (You'll also find the source code there.)

You'll also need the [Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015 RC](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=46881).
