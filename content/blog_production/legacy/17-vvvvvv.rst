:summary: I tell you why I liked VVVVVV.

I've finished VVVVVV today.

Super Meat Boy features Captain Viridian (VVVVVV's protagonist) as an
unlockable character, that's how I learned about the game. As part of
the Steam Holiday Sale it's available in the Indie 2D Pack for 4,50€.

So I got that pack and played VVVVVV (and the others too, as mentioned
earlier).  I like its gameplay in general, though the controls in Super
Meat Boy are nicer. Which is why I want to unlock Viridan in SMB and see
if it's any better there. Should be. Requires 90 bandages though... The
other thing I really liked about VVVVVV is its soundtrack. Some of the
songs can be streamed
`here <http://souleyedigitalmusic.bandcamp.com/>`__.

If you like the trailer I suggest you check it out - for `currently only
4,50€ <http://store.steampowered.com/sub/6915/>`__ you also get Geometry
Wars and Galcon Fusion, amongst others. I'm playing a lot of indie games
at the moment and it's a lot of fun. I ought to program something
myself, maybe a space shooting sidescroller.
