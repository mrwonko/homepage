:summary: My HDD seems to be broken, probably permanently.

Just a quick update on my HDD: It's not looking good. Sometimes it
works, sometimes it doesn't, and I'm happy I could backup its important
contents.

I'm not programming much recently, I've been playing games I bought
during the steam sale; I've had a lot of fun with Just Cause 2,
Prototype, Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light and Blur so far. KOTOR
doesn't work properly on widescreens, there are some bugs with the GUI
which may be linked to my widescreen.
