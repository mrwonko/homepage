:summary: Do I?

Michael Abrash may not have done his post on the things Valve is looking
for in potential employees yet, but another source came up: Valve's
`Handbook for new
employees <http://cdn.flamehaus.com/Valve_Handbook_LowRes.pdf>`__. As
the title suggests, it's supposed to help new employees understand how
things work at Valve. That includes tips on how to approach hiring,
because as always employees are free to do what they feel is best, which
includes the hiring process.

They've got quite the requirements, but that's understandable given
their lack of hierarchy and the high individual responsibility - not
everyone can work that way and people who can't may cause substantial
damage.

To work at Valve I should be:

-  A generalist, i.e. highly skilled at a lot of things. I may not
   exactly be "highly skilled", but I've sure got a broad range of
   experience: Modelling, animation, a little image editing, some
   electronics, webdesign and databases, drawing, basic video editing,
   crafting, cooking, mathematics, ... But yeah, I'm not exactly highly
   skilled in most of those.
-  An expert, i.e. one of the best at something. Compared to my other
   skills I'm an expert at coding and maybe to a lesser extent software
   design, but on an absolute scale I'm advanced at best. Uni will help,
   but I'll only become an expert through actual experience.
-  Better than the existing employees. Not necessarily in general but in
   some field. Haha. As if. Getting better than the best ones there at,
   say, coding would require a lot of learning. And the best place to
   learn new things is arguably Valve, so they'd likely only strengthen
   their lead.
-  Collaborative. I guess I fit that, although I have little experience
   of working on real projects in teams. Still, it's the trait Valve
   values above all so I may have a chance yet. If everybody who's
   better than me can't collaborate. Haha.
-  Productive. Well, I can be lazy at times, but when I work I do get
   things done, don't I? I just wrote `an implementation of the Spriter
   file format for SFML <https://github.com/mrwonko/SFMLSpriter>`__ in a
   day, although that's of course in part thanks to the simplicity of
   both the format and SFML. The goal was to be able to use it in Ludum
   Dare. Why am I not doing that right now?

So in conclusion I'm not someone they'd hire on the spot, but I may have
a chance. But who am I to say that? In order to get a better opinion I
just contacted Valve, asking whether they'd evaluate me and give me some
tips on how I should improve in the coming years so I can join them
after uni. I'll also try to talk to them some more at Gamescom, maybe do
a dummy-interview, though that won't work spontaneously. I'll have to
see about that.

So long,

Willi
