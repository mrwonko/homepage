:summary: Jedi Academy and Jedi Outcast Source Code WOOT! :D

I was going to write a long post about this, but I'm really to busy
poking around in the code. Jedi Academy and Jedi Outcast's full source
code was just released! This makes me very happy, obviously!

"Official" community repo is
`here <https://github.com/Razish/OpenJK>`__, although the maintainer is
currently offline so it's still in a broken state - Raven got their code
mixed up and accidentally released the XBox version in jediAcademy.zip,
which is currently in the repo. jediOutcast.zip contained the Jedi
Academy PC code, and JK2 code was missing altogether.

So now we can do anything. Personally looking forward to Oculus Rift
support most.
