:summary: Once again: 5 Indie games for a price you can choose! DRM free and cross-platform! Yay!

There's another `Humble Indie Bundle <http://www.humblebundle.com/>`__!

Included are Braid, Cortex Command, Machinarium, Osmos and Revenge of
the Titans, for a price you can choose yourself, with the option of
giving the money to charity. (Partially? Completely? Once again, you can
choose.)

I'm going to get it although I already own Braid. (Not on Linux though.
That's another nice thing about the bundle: You get the games on
Windows, Mac and Linux. And completely DRM free.) I've heard good things
about Machinarium, I'm interested in Revenge of the Titans and the other
two games probably aren't bad, either.

So go ahead and buy the thing as well. And be fair with the pricing!
