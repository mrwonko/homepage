:summary: Just a bit of me regretting not updating the blog more often. More posts to come.

So once again it's been over half a year since I last wrote something. I
originally planned to write a wall of text, but just as nobody would be
bothered to read that I couldn't be bothered to write it. So I'll write
multiple small entries instead.

After reading advice on keeping a journal so I can later look back at my
life I realized that this is very much that, so yay me for blogging, eh?
If only I'd keep it up. Like so much else. I tend to procrastinate,
unfortunately. For example I've meant to start writing down my knowledge
on Jedi Academy modding for about a month now. Alas, I still haven't
done it. I'm probably amongst the most knowledgeable Jedi Academy
modders and a lot of the old tutorials are no longer available so I
should get to it. Well, first I'll try to update this blog.
