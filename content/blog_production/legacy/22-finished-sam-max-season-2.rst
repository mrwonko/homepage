I just finished Sam & Max: Season 2. And I had a lot of fun! Probably
because it's a funny game. Laughed a lot. And when I was stuck the new
help system helped in a subtle way.

I'm looking forward to playing Season 3, which I believe will run in
Windows 7. (Unlike Season 2, which I had to play in XP - which is why I
hadn't played it until a couple of days ago, although I've had it since
November)

Hmm that's a pretty short entry... Maybe I should use Twitter for posts
like this and add a twitter widget? Maybe...
