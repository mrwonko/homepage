:summary: Darksiders Review: Good fun!

I'm done with Darksiders now. Not 100% done as in found every item,
bought every power etc., but I defeated the final boss and saw the
credits. That's enough.

Since it took me quite a while because I took some breaks I didn't get
the whole story, so I've got to read that up I think.

I had a lot of fun and liked the art style, I'm looking forward to
Darksiders 2.

Since I don't know what else to write I'll stop here.

So long,

Willi
