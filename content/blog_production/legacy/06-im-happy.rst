:summary: Isn't it great to accomplish stuff? I accomplished stuff, was lucky and had fun!

Lot's of nice things happening recently.

I'm back from a nice week in Amsterdam with my class. Visited some
museums as well as the Hard Rock Cafe Amsterdam, also ate quite some
Italian food, had a quick tour through the Blender Foundation (and got a
glimpse at all the nice tutorials going to be included on the Sintel DVD
I preordered) and watched Resident Evil Afterlife in English and 3D. I
also found out I like Jazz Clubs, I might visit some more in the future.

Now I'm back home and I've got... holidays! No school for 2 weeks. :-)

Remember when I told you about `my entry to the Midnight Riders Video
Contest <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYRtfJ5iShI>`__ in the last
post? I told you I wouldn't win (well, not in here the blog, but `I
wrote it in the Steam
Forums <http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showpost.php?p=17219954&postcount=529>`__)
- and I didn't win. But I *did* receive an `honorable
mention <http://www.l4d.com/blog/post.php?id=4433>`__ for "Best Use of
Black and White". Yay!

I stopped having fun with Darksiders, because now I'm having fun with
Dead Rising 2 which arrived shortly after the last post was written. I
have finished it twice by now, once with ending D, once with S, and I'm
not going to stop yet - it's a great game. Darksiders will have to wait,
it doesn't have as many zombies.

Talking about zombie games - do you know Zombie Driver? I know little about
it except that it exists and you drive around killing zombies. Well,
that's about to change since I just won it, together with the A New
Beginning soundtrack.

I'm off playing some more Dead Rising 2, see you next time!
