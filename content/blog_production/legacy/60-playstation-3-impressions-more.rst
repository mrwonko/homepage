Another month has passed, which means I skipped one blog post. Oh.

So in the last post I talked about how I was writing a 2048 AI for a uni
coding competition with Marcus. It did well enough, placing 4th out of
15 in the end. We placed 1st in Lines of Code though (no, that was not
an actual category), having written more than everybody else combined.
Madness.

I also finally contacted Thrustmaster regarding my Steering Wheel which
broke half a year ago and got a replacement thanks to the warranty. Yay!
Too bad it's not supported by Gran Turismo 6... I have to get a G27 one
day. And Gran Turismo 6. Probably not in that order.

Which brings me to PlayStation 3 games. I've got quite a couple now; in
addition to the previously mentioned Demon's Souls, Red Dead Redemption
and Okami HD there's now also the Metal Gear Solid Legacy Collection,
Unfinished Swan, Little Big Planet 2, Heavenly Sword, the Devil May Cry
HD Collection, Lollipop Chainsaw, God of War 3 and Bayonetta, as well as
the recent Playstation Plus games. And Uncharted 1 will arrive soon.

You may notice a slight focus on Hack & Slash games - that's because I
enjoy them and there are quite some console exclusive ones. In general
you'll notice I'm only getting exclusives - I still prefer my games on
PC given the choice.

Of course I haven't started all those games yet, let alone finished
them. Well, I finished Metal Gear Solid 1 and 2, which were a lot of
fun, and have just started Metal Gear Solid 3. Which brings me to a
little rant: Why are there region specific PlayStation Stores? I'd very
much like that MGS5 Ground Zeroes discount, why do I have to be American
to get it?

That aside I'm quite happy with the PS3. It's also a better BluRay
player than PowerDVD 9 which refused to run when my rotated screen is
connected.

In the coming weeks I'll still be somewhat busy with Uni work. Besides
that I'd like to do some R&D regarding JIT compilation - for starters
prepare some machine code, allocate some executable memory for it at
runtime and execute it.

So long,

Willi
