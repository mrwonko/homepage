:summary: Holidays! How should I spend them? How do I spend them? Do I regret anything? Answers be here!

So Christmas happened. That means I get/got two weeks of holiday,
starting Christmas and ending next weekend. A lot of time, I told myself
beforehand. Surely I can finish a lot of work!

Here's what I've done so far:

-  Finished Gemini Rue. Great story!
-  Finished Max Payne 3.
-  Got myself a Steering Wheel so racing games are more fun, and played
   some. It's nice, but gets in the way when trying to use the keyboard.
-  Played boardgames with friends. Great fun!

And here's what I had planned to do:

-  None of the above
-  Write a Blender Plugin for a friend
-  Improve my Blender Ghoul 2 Plugin
-  Write documentation for my Blender Plugins
-  Update my Python binding of the Sixense SDK (for the Razer Hydra
   motion controller) to Python 3.3 (which probably requires recompiling
   Boost.Python - how I loathe that!)
-  Write a game for Uni (that's supposed to be finished by the 14th -
   guess I won't be making that this Semester)
-  Do some other Uni work (some of which is supposed to be done ASAP, at
   the very last before next Monday, some by the 17th, some by the 18th)
-  Finish Reverse Engineering Flatout 2's level format so custom maps
   are possible
-  Get a coding job, maybe at Daedalic

In conclusion: I'm a lazy bum. Woe is me! It's not like I really dislike
any of the above, so I'm not even sure why I don't do it.

So, does that lead to any resolutions for the new year? I... don't know?
Maybe? I could participate in `One Game A
Month <http://www.onegameamonth.com/>`__, it's really in my best
interest. And how about another handy To-Do list of things I want to get
done this year?

-  All of the above
-  Help `iojamp <https://github.com/dmead/jkaq3>`__ by writing a Ghoul 2
   renderer
-  Finish `Spirits of the Sith <http://sots-dev.3d-get.de/>`__

Here's to another year of not getting as much done as I'd like.

So long,

Willi
