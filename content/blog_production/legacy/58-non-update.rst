:summary: Not much happened

You may have noticed I skipped the previous blog post. That's really
just because nothing interesting has happened.

Well, there's Dark Souls 2, whose world doesn't quite reach Dark Souls'
quality but which is still a great game. I've finished it once so far
and will look into New Game Plus eventually, where there are supposedly
quite a few changes.

But other than that there's not much to talk about. I've been toying
with the idea of buying a PlayStation 3 due to the number of interesting
games not available on PC (like Demon's Souls), but then again I still
have lots of unplayed games on PC so that's not going to happen any time
soon.

So long,

Willi
